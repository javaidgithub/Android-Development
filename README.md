In this assignment, I learned the following points:

**Flutter Project Structure:**
Separation of Concerns: I structured the project into separate folders (like models, widgets, and screens), ensuring scalability and maintainability.

**Widget Composition:**
List View and Navigation: I worked with ListView.builder to create a dynamic list of products and used Navigator.push to navigate between screens.
Full vs. Shallow Widget Trees: I applied both shallow trees (breaking down widgets into components) and full widget trees (where everything is composed within a single build method), gaining an understanding of how to manage complexity.

**Handling Images in Flutter:**
Image.network: I learned how to load images from the internet.

**Working with Layouts:**
Flexibility with SizedBox and BoxFit: I learned how to control the size and behavior of images and other UI components, making the app responsive and visually consistent.

**CrossAxisAlignment and MainAxisAlignment:** 
These helped me align content properly within my widgets.

**Custom Styling:**
Background Colors for List Items: I added custom styling to enhance the UI by alternating background colors for better readability.

**Output**
